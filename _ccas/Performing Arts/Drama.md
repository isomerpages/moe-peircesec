<h3>Unleashing the Power of Performance</h3>
<p>At Peirce Secondary School, our Drama Club is more than just an after-school
activity—it's a dynamic space where students can explore their creativity,
develop confidence, and express themselves through the transformative art
of theatre. Whether it's forum theatre or musical theatre, our students
thrive on the power of performance and engage with meaningful themes that
resonate with audiences.</p>

<p><strong>Our Two-Prong Approach in Drama</strong>
<br>At Peirce Secondary, our drama program takes a unique two-pronged approach,
focusing on:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Forum Theatre: Students engage with contemporary social issues through
interactive performances, sparking discussions and inspiring change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Musical Theatre: Students immerse themselves in the world of musical theatre,
combining acting, singing, and movement to bring stories to life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community Involvement&nbsp;</strong>
<br>Our Drama Club extends its reach beyond the stage, making a difference
in the community. We are proud of our collaboration with the Re:Act Symposium
at Victoria Theatre, where our forum theatre performances tackle contemporary
themes and engage audiences in meaningful dialogue. We also run community
outreach projects with the elderly, using drama to bridge generations and
foster empathy.</p>
