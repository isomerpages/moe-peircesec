# **School Song**

Fax Mentis Incendium Gloriae  
The passion for glory is the torch to the mind  
We of Peirce do pledge to achieve  
Excellence, honour for our school

We dare to venture; forward we go  
We know no obstacles along the way  
Those who fall will rise again  
And claim victory on another day

Let our ambitions be fulfilled  
Let our minds be liberated  
Let the flame of Peirce be ignited  
Fax Mentis Incendium Gloriae
