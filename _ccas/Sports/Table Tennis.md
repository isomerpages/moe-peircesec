The&nbsp;CCA&nbsp;aims to develop in our members a passion for Table Tennis such that&nbsp;they can use Table Tennis as a form of exercise and hobby. Through&nbsp;training, our members will develop into resilient, resourceful and responsible individuals. They will be taught the relevant techniques to play the sport. They will grow their mental toughness and emotional resilience. With exposure to National School Tournaments and External Cup Competitions, our members gain enriching tournament experiences where their skills, mental strength and emotional management are put into use.

**Desired Outcomes:**

The Table-tennis Team is an established Co-curricular Activity of the school. The CCA aims to cultivate, sportsmanship, camaraderie, life-long skills and the skills and techniques in playing the sport. This is achieved through the various events and activities that were organised for the students such as Intensive Training prior to the South Zone Competition, Training Cum Bonding Day Camp during the June holidays and CCA initiated Value-in-action Programme. Our vision is to introduce Table-tennis as a sport to all students who are interested in it, giving opportunities for student leaders to hone their skills and forge new friendships among teamates.

The team trains hard and school representatives strive to do their best in the South Zone Table-tennis Competition to bring glory and honour to the school. Under the guidance of our very dedicated Coach, Mr Ang Kok Hu, our players train twice a week for at least 6 hours at the school premise.  
As part of community involvement, a friendly match was organised with Ang Mo Kio Secondary. We hope to give all participants the opportunity to raise the standard of play and at the same time to make new friends across schools. We are proud to mention that Peirce Secondary is one of the top secondary schools in Table-tennis within the South Zone for ‘C’ Division (Girls) in 2022 and thus providing the team an ideal environment in their pursuit of the sport.
