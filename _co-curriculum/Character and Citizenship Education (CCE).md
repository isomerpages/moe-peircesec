**PSS CCE Curriculum**

Peirce Secondary School believes in developing resilient learners and gracious citizens. The design of the school’s CCE Curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame (Figure 1) and is anchored on the school’s values, vision and mission.

**Curriculum Content**

**CCE Lessons**  
The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It involves the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are taught and applied in the six curriculum content areas of CCE – _Education and Career Guidance, Cyber Wellness, National Education, Sexuality Education, Mental Health and Family Education_. CCE lessons are scheduled once per week and the lessons are customised to meet the needs of our students. 

**Contemporary Issues**  
Contemporary issues are discussed in CCE lessons to develop active citizenry and critical thinking among students. Through skillful facilitation by teachers, students are able to appreciate and understand the multiple perspectives present on current issues. 

**School-Based Lessons**  
School-based lessons are designed to focus on school values and to meet the needs of the students. Through the use of authentic scenarios in the lessons, we strive to empower them to make decisions based on sound moral values when they can relate closely to the materials. School-based lessons may be conducted during CCE period, FT-Time or Assembly.

### Approach and Pedagogy

**Thematic Approach based on Expanding Domains from self to the world**  
The development of children and adolescents takes place in the context of an ecosystem of relationships (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Through the use of expanding domains from self, family, school, community, nation and the world, CCE allows students to see relevance in what they learn. Studies have shown that students embrace their social roles as they interact with the world around them and act with consideration of the consequences of their actions on themselves and others.

**Student-Centric Pedagogy**  
The use of instructional and facilitation strategies such as circle structure, four corners, freeze frame, hot seat, round table, forum theatre, debate etc, promotes students’ voice and empowers students to express their views during CCE lessons. Through the interaction, it also strengthens both teacher-student relationships and student-student relationships.

With students owning their personal learning devices (PLDs), teachers can now utilize a whole range of digital platforms such as Student Learning Space, Padlet, Classpoint and Mentimeter to facilitate ICT-enabled CCE lessons.
