The Volleyball team trains and plays hard twice a week (either in school or online) under the expert hands of Mr Ho, the coach.&nbsp; The team has also participated in the B Division Zonal Competition, tapping on every possible opportunity to further hone our skills and achieve high standards of performance.&nbsp; We would like our members to enhance volleyball skill mastery through comprehensive and rigorous training.&nbsp; Through the intensive programme, the students would have the passion to excel and be imbued with a sense of responsibility.&nbsp; Participation in competitions allow the members to develop sportsmanship, resilience, self and social awareness â€“ values that would stand them in good stead in future.&nbsp; Lastly, we encourage team mates to treat each other with respect, courtesy and care.
