# **Values in Action (VIA)**

**VIA Framework****:** 

In Peirce, we use the tree root system (i.e. level of rootedness) as our VIA framework. All Peirceans are like tree saplings yearning to grow and be nurtured. With the right nutrients – tender loving care and guidance – the tree saplings will grow to be firmly rooted to the ground and bring benefits to their environment (community). 

**VIA Approach**: 

To grow and deepen the roots, we use the “Heart-Mind-Act” approach:

1.  Growing the Heart – To heighten Peirceans’ sense of empathy as they put others before self and take ownership of our environment. 
2.  Growing the Mind – To nurture Peirceans to perceive everyday problems as opportunities and ideate solutions creatively using Design Thinking. 
3.  Growing the Act – To provide opportunities for Peirceans to put values into action and be a change maker through serving the community.

**VIA Programme**: 

Our school’s VIA programme promotes active citizenry by involving our Secondary 1 & 2 students in a 30-week programme with the following VIA themes: 

1.  Rooted to School Programme (Sec 1)
2.  Rooted to Community & Environment Programme (Sec 2)

At Upper Secondary, students expand their scope of service to other Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) through student-initiated VIA and advocacy projects, with a focus on elderly needs and care.  

Our Secondary 1 students attend the Design Thinking Workshop to learn the problem solving thinking process which they will apply when looking for ideas and solutions to improve the school environment.
