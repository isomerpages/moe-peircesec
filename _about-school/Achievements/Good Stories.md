<h4><strong>Second Minister for Education Visit</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This week began with a visit from a very special guest, our Second Minister
for Education, Dr. Maliki Osman! Our VIP was warmly welcomed and accompanied
by the school leaders on a walkabout, where he first observed the areas
of the school affected by the LTA construction of an underground tunnel
for the Cross Island Line. He displayed concern for the well-being of staff
and students as he inquired about the nature of the construction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Amici Locus, meaning "a place where friends gather" in Latin, is a room
specifically set up to engage students after school and also used for some
GEAR-UP (Guiding &amp; Empowering Students for Affiliation &amp; Resilience
to Unlock their Potential) programmes. It piqued Dr. Maliki’s interest
as he sought to find out more about the school’s collaboration with external
organisations. He was also informed about how some of Pathlight School’s
students use PSS classrooms and participate in some of the school’s programmes.
Dr. Maliki also saw the heritage wall showing the memorable moments of
both Peirce Secondary and Bishan Park Secondary before they merged.</p>
<p>The highlights were certainly the dialogues with students and staff. Students
from various segments of the student population were set at ease at the
start of the dialogue when Dr. Maliki asked them how much they enjoyed
studying at PSS. During the session, Dr. Maliki patiently shared his advice,
insights, and even his life story on how they can take ownership of their
learning and avoid being trapped by societal pressures.</p>
<p>To the staff, Dr. Maliki acknowledged their suggestions and responded
to their questions. He affirmed the good work they have put in, assuring
them that the MOE would stand by them as long as their actions are in the
interest of the students.</p>
<p>It was certainly our honour that Dr. Maliki chose our school to share
his Teachers’ Day message with the fraternity! Dr. Maliki ended the visit
with a photo with the school leaders against the backdrop of the statue
of Yue Fei and his mother, a reminder of the values of loyalty to the nation
and filial piety.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations to Peirce Alumnus Suen Wai Kit on His Outstanding Achievements!</strong>
</p>
<p>Peirce Secondary School is proud to congratulate Suen Wai Kit, who has
graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a Diploma in Media, Arts &amp;
Design. He has also received the Mediacorp Silver Medal and the Mediacorp
Specialisation Prize for his outstanding accomplishments.</p>
<p>Wai Kit's journey into content creation began here at Peirce Secondary
School, where he discovered his passion for current affairs and filmmaking.
He was an active member of the Peirce Wind Symphony, where he not only
honed his ear for music and sound production but also began exploring other
creative interests. As the band's volunteer photographer, he set up its
Facebook page and produced a well-received video for the Handing Over Ceremony.
Wai Kit credits the opportunities he had through the Co-Curricular Activities
(CCA) and the guidance of Ms. Khai in Social Studies for inspiring his
career path, which now blends media, arts, and current affairs.</p>
<p>Wai Kit's accomplishments serve as an inspiration to all our students,
reminding us that discovering one's passion is a journey that often begins
with small steps. Participating in a variety of school activities can lead
to discovering new interests and pave the way for future success.</p>
<p>We are incredibly proud of Wai Kit's achievements and wish him continued
success as he embarks on the next steps in his journey. Congratulations,
Wai Kit! We look forward to seeing the incredible things you will achieve.</p>

<p><strong>Staff Learning Day</strong>
</p>
<p>This is the third year we are organising our bi-annual Staff Learning
Day since its inception in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>The theme for 2023 is “Nurturing Future-Ready Learners”</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>We believe that to nurture our students to be future-ready, we need to
enhance their ability to adjust their own cognition and learning and one
of the most effective ways to achieve this will be via the use of the feedback
loop.</p>
<p>Be it self or peer feedback, feedback is one of the most important strategies
of Formative Assessment, which emphasizes on giving students more autonomy
to reflect on their learning, evaluate and make adjustment to their own
learning. Thus, our Professional Learning Teams (PLTs) embarked on this
journey to explore how to make use of self and/or peer assessment to strengthen
students’ metacognition.</p>
<p>For 2023 Staff Learning Day, each department has selected one Professional
Learning Team to present and share their learning during the two concurrent
sessions. We are pleased to share the highlights of the concurrent sessions
(see below). To affirm and celebrate the learning and efforts by all teams,
all PLT synopses including those of the non-presenting teams, will be housed
in our Staff Learning Portal. Indeed, this Staff Learning Day is a testimonial
of the rich learning of our staff and their efforts in bringing the learning
of students to a new level while leveraging on the use of feedback.</p>
<p>For keynote address, we have invited Dr Farhan Ali, Assistant Professor
in the Learning Sciences and Assessment Academic Group, National Institute
of Education to share his insights on the topic of Social Emotional Learning
(SEL). In his talk, Dr Farhan Ali will highlight emerging research related
to the science of social-emotional learning. One of the key highlights
presented will be Dr Farhan’s integrated framework which involves emotion
experiences, emotion awareness, emotion regulation, and meta-emotion. His
presentation will also highlight some applications to the specific educational
contexts such as the learning of content-heavy subjects of Mathematics
and Science, Character and Citizenship Education, and promotion of self-directed
learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to learn from Dr Farhan how to enhance the use of feedback
in our teaching through knowledge of cognitive functions and self-directedness.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>2023 Staff Learning Day promises to be a rich learning experience for
us all!</p>
<p>Highlights of Concurrent Sessions:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Biology: <u>Using Success Criteria in the Feedback Cycle for Biology Planning Practical Task</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/biology.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: The Biology teachers designed a Learning Experience (LE) using
the extended Feedback model that allow students to consider the relationship
between these variables in diverse contexts, before transferring their
knowledge to a given scenario in an assessment.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Craft and Technology: <u>Strategies to Promote Metacognition through Peer Assessment and Self Assessment</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/design.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: Data captured in Padlet and Knowledge Forum were used to analyse
C&amp;T students’ thinking, how they learnt when they were involved in
peer assessment to determine if peer assessment and scaffold had enhanced
students’ metacognition.</p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>English Language: <u>Examining Efficacy of Feedback Style for Summary Writing for Secondary 2 Express</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/english.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: The inquiry method employed is a variant of confirmation inquiry
which seeks to affirm the value of peer feedback as opposed to self- evaluation
on refining the summary writing process. Each class is split into two,
with one solely pursuing self-evaluation/feedback while the other engages
in peer evaluation/feedback in assessing the style of summary writing.
It employs a modified checklist based on a simplified version of the SEAB
rubrics.</p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>History: <u>The Use of Rubrics in the Feedback Cycle for Source-Based Case Study Purpose Skill for Secondary 3 History Students</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/history.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: As students need to have clarity of what the SBQ skill entails,
the History teachers allowed for peer and teacher feedback to have students
to identify their gaps and monitor their understanding of the skill in
this project. After which, students will adjust their own learning by using
the rubrics and applying the learning from the feedback to check for understanding
once more.</p>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Chinese Language: <u>Enhance Secondary 1 Students’ Writing Skills through Peer Evaluation</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/chinese.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: In groups, students collaboratively wrote draft 1 based on
the writing skills required on Google Doc. After completing draft 1, the
teacher got students to highlight sentences which demonstrate the required
writing skills taught. The teacher then led the class to understand the
checklist on using the required writing skills in the appropriate way (tone,
suitability of situation and choice of words). Students then looked at
another group’s essay to assess them on the use and suitability of writing
skills, based on a simplified rubrics and checklist. Students then completed
draft 2 based on peer feedback. This is a very guided process of using
peer feedback for a group of very weak students which leads to positive
outcome.</p>
<ol start="6" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mathematics: <u>Using Flowcharts for Self-Assessment to Build Metacognition</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/mathematics.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: The intentional use of flowcharts and self and/or peer assessment
in the Feed up – Feedback – Feed forward cycle would encourage students
to be actively involved in assessment feedback, thus developing their competence
in monitoring, evaluating, and improving their own learning and enhancing
their capacities for lifelong learning.</p>
<ol start="7" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Pathlight School:<u>Understanding the Learning and Behavioural Needs of Students with ASD Informs Decisions on Classroom Strategies to Improve Their Overall Classroom Engagement</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/pathlight.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: The presentation provides actual classroom examples that have
been developed with the understanding that Students with ASD have preferences
and strengths we can leverage on to improve their engagement in the classroom.
It has enabled us to deliver the MOE curriculum in our Mathematics and
Science lessons, build our own efficacy to meet the needs of our students
and more importantly, improve the students’ self-reflection and self-management.
This in turn enables them to achieve their learning and behavioural goals.</p>
<ol start="8" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Physical Education: <u>Using ICT in Physical Education (PE)</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/physical.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: It was observed that students tend to forget the teaching cue
and were not able to execute the correct technical skills during practice.
The large space in which PE is being taught poses a challenge for PE teachers
to provide feedback to all students within a teaching period. By taping
on feedback and Kolb’s Cycle of Experiential Learning, students could become
more reflective learners who take ownership of improving their own technical
skills.</p>
