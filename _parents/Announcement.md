<p><strong><u>Announcement: Peirce Secondary School Secondary 1 posting and registration matters</u></strong>
<br>
<br>A very warm welcome to our Peirce Family!
<br>
<br>Please note that students <strong><u>do not need to report</u></strong> to
their posted secondary schools upon receiving their Secondary 1 posting
results.
<br>
<br>Should parents wish to speak with our Year Heads, School Counsellor, or
Special Needs Education Officer, you may do so on 19 December, Friday,
from 9am to 12pm. Please enter the school via the front gate as there is
some construction going on at the back gate this week. The back gate will
be available for use when school reopens.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Parents, please take note of the following important matters. Thank you
for your attention.
<br>
<br><strong>1. Registration</strong>
<br><strong>All parents must register their child at their posted school</strong> even
if they are seeking a transfer to another school. Registration must be
completed <strong>by 22 December 2025, 12 noon </strong>via the link shared
on Parent Gateway.
<br>Students seeking transfers should complete all administrative matters
and report on 2 January 2025, Friday, 7:30 am at the Parade Square until
the transfer is approved.
<br>
<br>For parents/guardians who are unable to access Parent Gateway, you may
use this link to complete the registration. Link: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/peircesec1registration2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/peircesec1registration2025</a>

Our staff will assist you.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>2.Appeals</strong>
<br><strong>2a. Medical Appeal Exercise (MAE)</strong>
<br>For MAE, transfer appeals will only be considered on exceptional basis
for students with serious medical conditions. All appeals must be accompanied
by relevant supporting documents and submitted to Peirce Secondary School
General Office before 12 noon on 22 December 2025.

the following form: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/appeal-in-2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/appeal-in-2025</a>

cut-off point for this year.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>3. Accepting offer to study subjects at a more demanding level</strong>
<br>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) has been implemented in all secondary
schools since 2024. Students may take English Language, Mother Tongue Languages,
Mathematics and/or Science, at a more demanding level from the start of
Secondary 1 based on their PSLE AL scores in the subject.
<br>
<br>Eligible students will be given letters of offer via Parent Gateway (PG)
or email. Parents/Guardians, together with their child/ward, must decide
whether to take up the offer <strong>by 26 December 2025, 10 am.</strong>
<br>
<br>If parents/ guardians do not respond by the deadline, the school will
take it as the student will not take up the offer, and the decision is
final.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>4. Purchase of textbooks and uniforms</strong>
<br>We encourage all parents/ guardians to <a href="https://asenciobookshop.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">purchase textbooks and uniforms online</a>.

home delivery for a fee.

to place their orders by 21 December, Asencio will be extending online
ordering until 29 December 2025. Please note that due to logistical constraints,
