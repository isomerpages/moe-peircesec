It began with an intake of 356 Secondary 1 pupils. On 17 February 1995, the school moved to its current premises at 10 Sin Ming Walk.

From 2007 to 2008, the school embarked on an upgrading exercise (PRIME Phase 8) of its premises to include an Indoor Sports Hall and other facilities. The project was completed on schedule and the school returned to its home campus in December 2008.The school’s synthetic turf was completed and put to use in June 2011. In 2014, we celebrated 20th anniversary of the school.

20th Anniversary school celebrations in August 2014 themed ‘Peirce, Our Home”. The many selfies of students with classmates or family arranged into a huge heart shape dons the wall and made its way into the Singapore Book of Records as the largest logo made of photos.

Bishan Park Secondary School and Peirce Secondary School merged with effect from 2 January 2018. The merged school operated as Peirce Secondary School at 10 Sin Ming Walk.

Over the years, it has made progress in becoming a choice school for students staying in the surrounding districts of Sin Ming, Bishan, Ang Mo Kio and Upper Thomson. Some of its main feeder primary schools include Ai Tong School, Ang Mo Kio Primary, Pei Chun Public, Catholic High School, Townsville Primary and Marymount Convent.

^cut-off  
\*The last student posted to the school had a PSLE Score better than 30. However, as the school still had vacancies after S1 posting, its cut-off point is reflected as 30 as it could have admitted a S1-eligible student with PSLE score of 30.
