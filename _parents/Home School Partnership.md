<p><strong>Principles for communication</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our school adopts a<strong> collaborative approach</strong> between parents and staff to address students’ needs. We update parents on students’ progress holistically and seek to establish strong home-school partnerships to serve the best interests of our students.</li>
<li>We are committed to maintaining a<strong> culture of open and constructive dialogue</strong> that supports resolution of issues and successful collaboration.</li>
<li>We forge strong parent-school relationships that are premised on <strong>trust and respect</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Communication Channels</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>General Office: Tel: 6457 6454</li>
<li>School email: <a href="mailto:peirce_ss@moe.edu.sg">peirce_ss@moe.edu.sg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For email addresses of specific staff, parents may refer to: <a href="https://www.peircesec.moe.edu.sg/about-school/Staff/Staff-list/">https://www.peircesec.moe.edu.sg/about-school/Staff/Staff-list/</a></p>

<p><strong>Guidelines </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Staff should be contacted through their email addresses or the General Office by default, although they may opt to share their handphone numbers with students and parents.</li>
<li>Phone calls/WhatsApp messages should only be made during school operating hours (7.30am – 6pm on weekdays) unless there is an emergency.</li>
<li>Urgent messages to staff members may be directed to the school’s General Office, should they be uncontactable during school hours.</li>
<li>For in-depth discussions on issues, meetings may be arranged with at least 3 days’ notice. Staff have the discretion to schedule earlier meetings if deemed necessary.</li>
<li>The school advocates trust and mutual respect in all communication. In the unlikely event that disrespectful communication takes place, the school will choose not to engage with the party concerned.</li>
</ol>
