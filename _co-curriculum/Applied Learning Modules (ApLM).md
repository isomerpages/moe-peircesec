<h3>Applied Learning @ Polytechnics</h3>
<p>ApLM are enrichment modules that broaden the learning experiences of students
and complement the secondary school curriculum with a focus on the practical
application of knowledge. These modules provide our students with applied
learning opportunities â€“ learning that involves learning by doing, learning
about the real world, and learning for life. It allows students to discover
their interests and strengths and make informed education and career choices.</p>
<p>At Peirce Secondary School, we expose Secondary 2 - 4 students to ApLMs
@ Polytechnics to inspire them to have an aspirational pathway to work
towards. These modules will be conducted at the Polytechnics, and may take
place during Term time or the school holidays.</p>
