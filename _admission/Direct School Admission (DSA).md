**I.Developing Community Leaders with the Heart to Serve through Uniformed Groups**
![](/images/dsa221-1024x382-1.png)

The Uniformed Groups (UGs) in Peirce Secondary is an important part of the Peircean community where the total membership forms almost a fifth of the student population.&nbsp; Vibrant and energetic, we see Uniformed Groups as one of our pillars of character development and leadership education at Peirce.&nbsp; They provide experiences for all-round holistic development of Peirceans to achieve our vision of ‘Resilient Learners, Gracious Citizens’.

There will be&nbsp;**three**&nbsp;uniformed groups in the school in 2024:
*   National Cadet Corps (Land) - Boys
*   National Police Cadet Corps
*   Scouts

We are proud of the growth and development of our Uniformed Groups which have consistently attained good achievements all these years.

We are looking for students who can contribute to building our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in character and leadership development through the Uniformed Groups. Students who wish to be part of the Peircean experience should apply via the 2023 Direct School Admission Exercise.

**Qualifying Criteria**
*   **Leadership**   
A student leader in primary school, preferably in a Uniformed Group (although other co-curricular leadership experiences may be considered).
*   **Physical Fitness**   
Is medically fit to participate in PE programme and outdoor activities.
*   **Character**   
A disciplined and confident student with a conduct grade of at least ‘Very Good’ in his/her Primary 5 and Primary 6 school reports.
**II. Deepening Reflection and Developing Critical Thinking Through Media**
The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Peirce Secondary School facilitates students’ reflection on print and non-print materials they read and view, allowing them to connect with and respond to what they read and view personally and critically. Responding both in written and audio formats, the programme provides students an authentic learning platform to hone their writing and oral skills. Students also participate in peer critique where they learn to think critically and provide constructive feedback to their peers for improvements. Collaboration is conducted via e-platforms such as Padlet and Google Classroom, building not just the digital literacy of our students but also providing opportunities for them to blossom into collaborative learners and confident speakers.

**Qualifying Criteria**<br>
We are looking for enthusiastic P6 students who:
*   possess accomplishments in media, such as, videos, podcasts, presentations, publications and/or other related skills and competencies;
*   demonstrate keen interest in current affairs, both local and global.

Shortlisted candidates will attend an in-person interview and be assessed on their experiences of the above as well as confidence and quality in oral presentation.
