The Uniformed Groups (UGs) in Peirce Secondary is an important part of the Peircean community where the total membership forms almost a fifth of the student population.  Vibrant and energetic, we see Uniformed Groups as one of our pillars of character development and leadership education at Peirce.  They provide experiences for all-round holistic development of Peirceans to achieve our vision of ‘Resilient Learners, Gracious Citizens’.

Currently there are **four** uniformed groups in the school:

*   National Cadet Corps (Land) - Boys
*   National Police Cadet Corps
*   Scouts
*   St John Brigade

We are proud of the growth and development of our Uniformed Groups which have consistently attained good achievements all these years.

We are looking for students who can contribute to building our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in character and leadership development through the Uniformed Groups. Students who wish to be part of the Peircean experience should apply via the 2022 Direct School Admission Exercise.
