<b>Front Porch</b>

Our driveway features a wide roundabout for you to drop off and pick up your child/ward, with our iconic statue of Yue Fei and his mother. Our porch also has benches for use, so that students need not stand around to wait. Our OM frequently oversees the traffic in order to facilitate dismissal- this not only guarantees your child’s safety but it also means no traffic jams during pick up!
