<h4><strong>VIA Framework:&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Our school's Values in Action (VIA) programme is designed to nurture students
into empathetic, thoughtful, and proactive citizens who make meaningful
contributions to society. We employ a progressive "Head, Heart, and Hands"
framework that aligns with the "Awareness, Action, and Advocacy" approach
as students advance in their 4-5 years with us.</p>

</p>
<p>The VIA programme is seamlessly integrated into our Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) curriculum, strengthening the connection between empathy
and action. This integration ensures that students not only learn about
values but also understand how to apply them in real-world contexts.</p>
<p>Our framework is structured as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary 1: Open Minds, Aware Hearts - Our Journey Begins</strong>
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus: Understanding
school values and community needs
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activities: Classroom
discussions, school-based environmental projects</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary 2: Empathy in Action - From Heart to Hands</strong>
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus: Developing empathy
and initiating small-scale community projects
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activities: Partnering
with local organisations, participating in community events</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary 3: Hands-on Impact - Turning Action into Change</strong>
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus: Extension of
small-scale community projects and learning from VWOs on implementing larger
community service projects; seeking causes for advocacy
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activities: Partnering
with local organisations for student-initiated projects</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary 4: Raising Voices - Advocates for Tomorrow</strong>
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus: Leading initiatives
and inspiring others to act
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activities: Organising
school-wide campaigns, mentoring younger students in VIA projects</p>
<p>Throughout these levels, we leverage partnerships with community organisations
to enhance our school events. For instance, our annual Karneval on National
Day Celebrations involves collaboration with active aging centres within
our neighbouring community, providing students with real-world experiences
in event planning and community engagement.</p>

<p>An emergent feature of our VIA programme is the incorporation of intergenerational
learning into our Learning for Life Programme (LLP). This initiative brings
together students and seniors, fostering mutual understanding and respect
across generations. Activities include joint workshops, shared learning
experiences, and collaborative projects that benefit both age groups.</p>

</p>
<p>By progressively building students' capacity from awareness to advocacy,
and by providing diverse opportunities for engagement, our VIA programme
aims to cultivate lifelong habits of active citizenship and community service.
As students progress through each level, embracing the spirit of each theme,
they develop into well-rounded individuals ready to make a positive impact
in their communities and beyond.</p>
