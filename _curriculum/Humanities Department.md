<h3>2. Department Philosophy</h3>
<p>The department is committed to nurturing resilient learners who are critical
thinkers that honour the past, engage thoughtfully with the present, and
confidently shape the future. Through the study of History, Geography,
and Social Studies, we empower our students with the knowledge and skills
to engage meaningfully with the world and navigate its complexities with
confidence.</p>
<p>At the heart of our philosophy is the belief that every student can thrive
in the Humanities through a nurturing and supportive environment. We are
dedicated to guiding our students while nurturing their self-directedness,
empowering them to realize their fullest potential.</p>
<p>We achieve this through a concept-driven curriculum that emphasizes disciplinary
literacy, critical thinking, the nurturing of core values and 21st-century
competencies.</p>
<p>Our key pedagogical approaches include active learning through inquiry-based
methods, discussion-driven lessons, and technology-enhanced learning. We
also emphasize differentiated instruction and the provision of effective
feedback to strengthen academic resilience.</p>
<p><strong>Department Logo Description</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>heart</strong> in our logo symbolizes empathy, compassion, and
care — values at the core of Humanities education. It also reflects our
commitment to developing 21st Century Competencies (21CC) such as emotional
intelligence, social awareness, and collaboration.</p>
<p>The <strong>fingerprint</strong> within the heart represents each student's
individuality and identity, highlighting how we nurture critical thinking
and inquiry-based learning. It also reminds students of their potential
to leave a meaningful impact on society.</p>
<p>Together, the heart and fingerprint capture our vision of growing empathetic,
thoughtful, and active global citizens who think deeply, communicate effectively,
and act responsibly.</p>
<h3>3. Department Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>(a) Humanities Investigations</strong>
<br><strong>Historical Investigations (HI), Geographical Investigations (GI) &amp; Issues Investigation (II)</strong>
<br><strong>Objectives of the Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Our signature Humanities programmes — Historical Investigations (HI),
Geographical Investigations (GI), and Issues Investigation (II) — adopt
an inquiry-based approach to engage students in exploring historical, geographical,
and societal issues. Through collaborative group work, students are guided
to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Examine and understand compelling inquiry questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gather, select, and evaluate a range of relevant sources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct well-reasoned responses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate their findings effectively</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This real-world approach to learning allows students to see the relevance
of Humanities beyond the classroom and strengthens key 21st Century Competencies
such as critical thinking, communication, and collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Process</strong>
</p>
<p>The investigations follow a structured inquiry process beginning with
a driving question rooted in historical, geographical, or societal contexts.
Students then gather data to address their inquiry through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Learning journeys for Lower Secondary students to sites such as the <strong>National Museum</strong>, <strong>Changi Chapel Museum</strong>, <strong>Former</strong>  <strong>Ford Factory</strong>,
Reflections at Bukit Chandu and <strong>Bishan Park</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fieldwork for Upper Secondary students to locations such as <strong>Sentosa, HDB Gallery, URA City Gallery, Science Centre</strong> and <strong>Chinatown.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engagements with community stakeholders like the <strong>Migrant Workers Association</strong> and <strong>MOM School Partnership Programme</strong> who
provide valuable insights and data through talks, discussions and Learning
Journey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After data collection, students return to class to analyse and interpret
the information, construct explanations, and present their findings. The
process culminates in group presentations and reflective discussions to
consolidate their learning experience.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits to Students</strong>
</p>
<p>These inquiry projects empower students to apply Humanities knowledge
and skills in authentic, real-world contexts. They help students develop:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A deeper appreciation of History, Geography, and Social Studies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research, analytical, and communication skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teamwork and interpersonal competencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A critical and reflective mindset</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For our lower secondary students who are new to the Humanities subjects,
and for Secondary 3 students new to Social Studies, these projects adopt
a <strong>guided inquiry approach</strong>. Teachers provide structured
support to help students navigate the inquiry process and understand performance
expectations.</p>

<p><strong>(b) The Humanities Inquiry Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>Our department uses the Inquiry-Based Approach in the teaching of all
Humanities subjects. This approach is built on four key pedagogical elements:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Question-Driven Learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence-Based Reasoning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflective Thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge Construction</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These are enacted through the four stages of the inquiry process:<br></strong>Stage
1: Sparking Curiosity
<br>Stage 2: Gathering Data
<br>Stage 3: Exercising Reasoning
<br>Stage 4: Reflective Thinking</p>
<p>Through this process, our students learn to be inquisitive, thoughtful,
and analytical individuals, capable of making well-reasoned judgments rooted
in evidence and reflection. Teachers design meaningful inquiry lessons
using this framework to nurture active learners who can make sense of the
complex world around them.</p>
<p><strong>(c) Talent Development programme</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of enriching students’ experiences in Humanities, opportunities
are provided to students to participate in externally organized competitions
and interaction sessions.</p>
<p><u>Feb - March: NUS Geography Challenge 2025</u>
</p>
<p>NUS Geography Challenge is an annual Geography competition organised by
the NUS Department of Geography and NUS Geographical Society, with support
from the Ministry of Education.</p>

<p><u>March: Model United Nations trainings</u>
</p>
<p>MUN training sessions prepare participants for Model MUN conferences,
where they simulate the roles of delegates representing countries in UN
committees.</p>
<p><u>April: National Youth Environment Council (NYEC) in Nan Hua High School</u>
</p>
<p>The 5th National Youth Environment Conference (NYEC) 2025, themed "Advocating

Nan Hua High School's sKy Leaders and Service-Learning Club. This Model
United Nations (MUN) Conference engages youths in environmental discussions,
fostering Civic, Global and Cross-Cultural Literacy.</p>
<p>The participants analyse complex issues and devise innovative solutions,

roles of diplomats and world leaders, fostering a deeper understanding
of global environmental challenges. NYEC 2025 aims to nurture environmentally
conscious leaders who are adept at navigating complexities in our rapidly
changing world.</p>
