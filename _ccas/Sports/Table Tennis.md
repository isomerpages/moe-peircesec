<p>The CCA aims to develop in our members a passion for Table Tennis such
that they can use Table Tennis as a form of exercise and hobby. Through
training, our members will develop into resilient, resourceful and responsible
individuals. They will be taught the relevant techniques to play the sport.
They will grow their mental toughness and emotional resilience. With exposure
to National School Tournaments and External Cup Competitions, our members
gain enriching tournament experiences where their skills, mental strength
and emotional management are put into use.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong>
<br>The Table-tennis Team is an established Co-curricular Activity of the
school. The CCA aims to cultivate sportsmanship, camaraderie, life-long
skills and the skills and techniques in playing the sport. This is achieved
through the various events and activities that were organised for the students
such as Intensive Training prior to the South Zone Competition, Training
Cum Bonding Day Camp during the June holidays and CCA initiated Value-in-action
Programme. Our vision is to introduce Table-tennis as a sport to all students
who are interested in it, giving opportunities for student leaders to hone
their skills and forge new friendships among teammates.</p>
<p>The team trains hard and school representatives strive to do their best
in the South Zone Table-tennis Competition to bring glory and honour to
the school. Under the guidance of our very dedicated Coach, Mr Ang Kok
Hu, our players train twice a week for at least 6 hours at the school premises.</p>
<p>As part of community involvement, a friendly match was organised with
Ang Mo Kio Secondary. We hope to give all participants the opportunity
to raise the standard of play and at the same time to make new friends
across schools. We are proud to mention that Peirce Secondary is one of
the top secondary schools in Table-tennis within the South Zone for ‘C’
Division (Girls) in 2022 and thus providing the team an ideal environment
in their pursuit of the sport.</p>
