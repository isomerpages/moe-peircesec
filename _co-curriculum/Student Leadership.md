**Key Approaches and Strategies**

The student leadership structure offers a few tracks, the key ones being appointments in the Student Council, Class Committee and CCA Leaders. Student Councilors and CCA Leaders form the Student Leadership Board (SLB). Differentiated leadership development is provided to help all leaders receive baseline training while stretching some for more advanced development. The leadership training programme aims to equip leaders with relevant knowledge and skills to enhance their leadership competencies and help them thrive in their leadership roles. 

The SLB adopts the Student Leadership Challenge model and student leaders are guided by the five practices of Exemplary Leadership in their leadership journey. Besides, these leaders are also introduced to skills like project management, peer supporting, communication skills and risk assessment management. 

SLB members work in teams to plan and execute projects and school events such as loan of equipment, classroom cleanliness, Sec 1 Orientation, Teacher’s Day celebration, Health & Fitness Week and other programmes. Through these involvements, they gain valuable experiential learning opportunities, benefit from peer interaction, build their confidence and leadership capacity and develop 21st century competencies.
