In Peirce Secondary School, ICT department adopts the Computer Education (CE) Framework. An important aspect of the framework is the relationship between the Core Concepts, Computation Thinking and Practices: Core Concepts and Computational Thinking are applied in the Practices, and the Practices will in turn deepen one’s understanding of the Core Concepts.

The CE framework comprises three dimensions:

*   Computer Science
*   Computer as Tools
*   Computers and Society

These three dimensions undergird the broad ideas of systems thinking and computational thinking inherent in the study of Computing.

**Computer Science**

Computer Science is the study of computers and computing concepts. This dimension focuses on computer systems, networks, data processing and programming. 

**Computers as Tools**

This dimension includes the use of computing devices and computer application software, covering advanced features that allow for task automation and customization. 

**Computers and Society**

This dimension focuses on the impact of computers and technology on society, as well as the ethical, legal and security issues relating to the use of computers. 

Peirce Secondary School consists of a passionate group of teachers who are committed to empowering our students to become computational thinkers and competent and ethical computer users, equipped with 21st Century Competencies (21CC) skills. O-Level Computing and N-Level Computer Applications curricula are aligned with the Standards and Benchmarks for 21CC as shown in the diagram below.
