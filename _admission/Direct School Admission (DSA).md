# **DSA Exercise 2023**

### DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION EXERCISE 2023  
(For Secondary One Intake in 2024)

      
Peirce Secondary School offers DSA in two areas for the Secondary One Intake in 2024. The first area is a Learning for Life Programme (LLP) titled: ‘**Developing Community Leaders with the Heart to Serve through Uniformed Groups’**.  Successful applicants will enrol into one of the three Uniformed Groups in the school, namely National Cadet Corps (Land) – for Boys only, National Police Cadet Corps and Scouts.

The second area is an Applied Learning Programme (ALP) which focuses on **'Deepening reflection and developing critical thinking through media’**. The ALP facilitates students’ reflection of print and non-print materials they read and view, allowing them to connect with and respond to what they read and view personally and critically. Responding both in written and audio formats, the programme provides students an authentic learning platform to hone their writing and oral skills. Students also participate in peer critique where they learn to think critically and provide constructive feedback to their peers for improvements. Collaboration is conducted via e-platforms such as Padlet and Google Slides, building not just the digital literacy of our students but also providing opportunities for them to blossom into collaborative learners and confident speakers

Do look out for more information on the two areas from 3 May.
