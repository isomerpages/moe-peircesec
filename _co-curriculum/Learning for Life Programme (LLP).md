<h4><strong>Nurturing Community Leaders with a Heart to Serve</strong></h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>At Peirce Secondary School, our Learning for Life
Programme (LLP) focuses on nurturing students in the area of Community
and Youth Leadership.
<br>This programme is designed to provide students with authentic, real-world
experiences that promote holistic development beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Through the LLP, we aim to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Enhance social-emotional competencies, values, and life skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster a strong sense of rootedness, empathy, and responsibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate active citizens who are committed to making a difference in
their communities and in Singapore</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our LLP is anchored by two key programmes:
<br>1. Values in Action (VIA)
<br>2. Student Leadership Development</p>
<p><strong>(1) Values in Action (VIA)</strong>
</p>
<p>The VIA programme empowers Peirceans to take meaningful action within
and beyond school, helping them become contributors to society. Students
engage in VIA projects that address real community needs, cultivating empathy,
initiative, and a strong moral compass.</p>
<p>Objectives of VIA:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Apply personal values, strengths, and interests to positively influence
others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiate and carry out purposeful activities to meet the needs of the
school or community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve as advocates for positive change, showing responsibility and commitment
to the well-being of others</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects may be carried out within the school, in the local community,
or in collaboration with external organisations.</p>

<p><strong>(2) Student Leadership Training</strong>
</p>
<p>At Peirce, we nurture Community Leaders — individuals who lead with heart,
empathy, and a sense of service.
<br>Student leadership is a vital pillar in realising our school vision of
nurturing Resilient<strong> </strong>Achievers and Responsible Citizens.</p>
<p>Our Community Leaders:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Demonstrate empathy and understanding of community needs (Values)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show the courage and willingness to serve and improve the lives of others
(Social-Emotional Learning)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are equipped with the competence to plan, lead, and implement community
projects that bring about meaningful impact (Competencies)</p>
</li>

<p>Together, these two programmes form the heart of Peirce’s LLP, shaping
students into confident, compassionate, and community-oriented leaders.</p>
