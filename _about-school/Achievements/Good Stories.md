The care and compassion from the teachers at Peirce will always resonate with me. Ever ready to provide a listening ear and sage advice, they connected with sincerity, and it was this sincerity that inspired me to pursue social work.

A student who was all heart, Amalia graduated from Peirce in 2016 with numerous accolades to her name. Having been relentless in her academic pursuits, Amalia clinched the Edusave Scholarship Award for 3 consecutive years from 2013-2015.

	<p>
With leadership opportunities being aplenty at Peirce, Amalia was not only an active member of the Student Council but thrived in her CCA- St John’s Brigade. She was bestowed the coveted title of Senior Staff Sergeant in 2016, the highest achievement at the secondary school level. With the guidance of her CCA teachers, she was awarded Best Unit Cadet Award as well as the Chief Commissioner’s Award in 2016. Apart from her academic and CCA achievements, the school recognized Amalia for her exemplary character and personal qualities and awarded her the Peirce Secondary Character Award in 2016.

Teachers who were blessed with her presence in class remember her fondly as an all-rounded young lady who displayed the passion to excel and care for others in all aspects of her school life. “Amalia went above and beyond what was required by the syllabus and was always keen to develop the skills for content mastery. She also willingly shared learning resources with her friends and never failed to help her classmates who were weaker”, Ms Khai, the HoD of Humanities, had this to share about Amalia. Mr Dennis Goh, the HoD of Mathematics, also had glowing words for her. “Apart from being a hardworking and exemplary student, Amalia was unrivaled in her ability to cultivate and maintain strong peer relationships.”

Amalia graduated from Peirce Secondary and went on to pursue the Diploma in Social Sciences (Social Work) at Nanyang Polytechnic. There, she was awarded the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) Gold Medal. Amalia is currently majoring in Social Work and minoring in Sociology at the National University of Singapore. Having developed a keen interest in youth advocacy, Amalia contributed a series of articles to non-profit organizations in hopes of reaching out to troubled youth. She also interned at Beyond Social Services and MSF’s Child Protective Service, where she continues to volunteer today.

I intend to become a social worker upon my graduation from university. If there is one thing I’ve taken away from my time at Peirce, it is the kindness and compassion my teachers have showered on me, and I want to be able to touch lives and pay this forward!
