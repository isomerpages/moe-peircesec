<h4><strong>3. Department Programme</strong></h4>
<p>At Peirce Secondary School, the learning of Science is guided by a holistic
philosophy that seeks to strike thoughtful and purposeful balances in the
way we teach and engage students. These balances reflect our commitment
to nurturing scientifically literate, curious, and resilient learners who
are prepared for the challenges of the future. Our Science curriculum is
encapsulated in the following five key statements:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A balance between hands-on experience and theoretical exploration:</strong>
<br>We believe that students learn best when they actively engage with the
world around them. Our lessons blend practical, hands-on experiments with
conceptual understanding to help students see the relevance of scientific
principles in everyday life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A balance between academic rigour and the joy of learning:</strong>
<br>While we uphold high standards of academic excellence, we also believe
that learning Science should be a joyful and inspiring experience. We design
learning activities that are both challenging and enjoyable, sparking curiosity
and deepening interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A balance between broad exposure and deep learning:</strong>
<br>Our students are introduced to a wide range of scientific concepts and
real-world applications, while also being given opportunities to dive deeper
into selected topics. This approach builds both breadth and depth in their
scientific understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A balance between the use of technology and face-to-face interaction:</strong>
<br>We integrate digital tools and platforms to enhance scientific inquiry
and learning, while also valuing collaborative discussions, peer learning,
and teacher-student interactions that build critical thinking and communication
skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A balance between syllabus coverage and learning beyond the textbook:</strong>
<br>While we ensure that students master the required syllabus, we also encourage
exploration beyond the classroom. Through enrichment programmes, science-related
competitions, and project-based learning, students are inspired to make
connections between what they learn and the real world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To further enrich our students' learning experience, we offer a wide range
of opportunities beyond the classroom. These include participation in national
and school-based programmes such as the <strong><em>STEM Playground Challenges, Singapore Junior Physics, Chemistry and Biology Olympiads, the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair, the MOE ignITE Challenge, Science Buskers Festival, National Crystal Growing Competition, and Science Elementz.</em></strong> Students
also benefit from learning journeys to places like the <strong>Science Centre</strong>.
These experiences are designed to deepen their scientific curiosity, broaden
their perspectives, and apply their learning in authentic contexts. Do

in action.</p>
