Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)
-------------------------------

The CCA programme at Peirce provides students a platform to learn new skills, develop their talents and make new friends. Besides, students also learn core values and enhance their social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies.

The school has four broad categories of CCAs, namely Sports, Visual & Performing Arts, Uniformed Groups and Clubs.  Each CCA has its specific objectives. The Sports CCAs aim to develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in the athletes. The Visual and Performing Arts CCAs instill in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the arts. The Uniformed Groups (UG) aim to inculcate in cadets self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others. The clubs provide opportunities for students to explore and develop their interests.
