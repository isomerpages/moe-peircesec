<p><strong>Key Approaches and Strategies</strong>
</p>
<p>The student leadership structure offers a few tracks, the key ones being
appointments in the Student Council, Class Committee and CCA Leaders. Student
Councilors and CCA Leaders form the Student Leadership Board (SLB). Differentiated
leadership development is provided to help all leaders receive baseline
training while stretching some for more advanced development. The leadership
training programme aims to equip leaders with relevant knowledge and skills
to enhance their leadership competencies and help them thrive in their
leadership roles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SLB adopts the Student Leadership Challenge model and student leaders
are guided by the five practices of Exemplary Leadership in their leadership
journey. Besides, these leaders are also introduced to skills like project
management, peer supporting, communication skills and risk assessment management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SLB members work in teams to plan and execute projects and school events
such as loan of equipment, classroom cleanliness, Sec 1 Orientation, Teacher’s
Day celebration, Health &amp; Fitness Week and other programmes. Through
these involvements, they gain valuable experiential learning opportunities,
benefit from peer interaction, build their confidence and leadership capacity
and develop emerging 21st&nbsp;century competencies.</p>
