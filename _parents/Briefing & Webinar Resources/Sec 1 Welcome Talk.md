<p>To prepare your son for the O-Level exams, focus on consistent study habits,
time management, and seeking help early for subjects he struggles with.
If O-Levels are challenging, explore ITE options that align with his interests
and strengths, as they provide hands-on learning and clear pathways for
future education and careers. Staying open to both pathways ensures he’s
prepared for success regardless of the outcome.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>It is not compulsory to pass Chinese for progression from one level to
the next. However, students are offered the option to take Mother Tongue
at a less demanding level only if they score an E8 or below in their end-of-year
examinations.
<br>
<br>We encourage your child to give their best effort before deciding whether
to move to a less demanding level, as developing academic resilience is

<p>For 2024, we offered G3 students two options for subject combinations:
an 8-subject combination or a 7-subject combination.
<br>8-Subject Combination:
<br>This option includes Pure Sciences and Additional Mathematics.
<br>Students can choose to take either Pure Humanities, Computing, or Triple
Science as part of this combination.
<br>7-Subject Combination:
<br>This option includes Combined Science.
<br>Students have the flexibility to select from Additional Mathematics, or
coursework-based subjects.

<p>If my child in G3 doesn't do well in Sec 1, will she go to G2? On what
basis? Is it recommended by teachers and can parents have a say?</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Your child's progression will depend on her academic performance and overall
readiness. Generally, we encourage students to continue at the G3 level.
However, in some cases, we may recommend that a student either repeat the
year or drop to the G2 level for certain subjects.
<br>
<br>These decisions are made based on teachers' recommendations and aligned
with MOE guidelines, ensuring that the best interests of the student are
considered. Each case is carefully assessed on an individual basis. Parents
will be consulted during this process and will have an opportunity to discuss
the recommendation and provide input.</p>

</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The school requires students to wear their full uniform on Mondays and
Tuesdays to maintain a professional and disciplined appearance, fostering
a sense of pride and identity. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, students have
the flexibility to wear the school polo tee with school shorts or skirts,
and on Fridays, they can wear the PE shirt with school shorts or skirts.
Changing into PE attire for lessons helps ensure comfort and hygiene, as
physical activities can leave students sweaty and uncomfortable. We appreciate
your understanding and support in upholding these standards.</p>

</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Starting in Term 2, our school will introduce the Student-Initiated Learning
(SIL) programme during the fortnightly Home-Based Learning (HBL) sessions.
This initiative provides students with dedicated time and opportunities
to explore their interests and passions beyond the classroom. For example,
last year, a student who self-taught video editing created a beautiful
video montage for Deepavali, which was featured on our school’s Instagram
account. Through such experiences, we aim to nurture students’ talents
and encourage them to contribute meaningfully to the school community in
their areas of passion.
<br>
<br>Additionally, we encourage students to participate in internal and external
competitions, which provide valuable platforms to showcase their skills
and further develop their interests.</p>
