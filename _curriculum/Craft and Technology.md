<h3>2. Department Programmes</h3>
<p><strong><em>a)&nbsp; Artist-in-School Scheme (AISS)<br></em></strong>Objective:
To develop students’ awareness, skills, and understanding of the visual
arts, with a focus on art criticism, portfolio building, and exhibition
curation.</p>
<p>The Artist-in-School Scheme (AISS) provides students with unique, customised
art learning experiences by connecting them directly with practising art
professionals. Through workshops and mentorship sessions, students deepen
their understanding of artistic concepts and processes while gaining first-hand
exposure to industry practices.</p>
<p>Students refine essential skills such as critical analysis of artworks,
portfolio development for further studies, and curating exhibitions to
showcase artistic narratives. The programme also offers rare behind-the-scenes
insights into the realities of working in the creative sector, as artists
share personal experiences and career journeys within the evolving art
scene.</p>
<p>Ultimately, AISS empowers students not just to create art, but to think,
critique, and present like true art practitioners.</p>
<p><strong><em>b) Museum Art Education Package</em></strong>
<br>Objective: To develop students’ ability to perceive, appreciate, and communicate
through the visual arts.</p>
<p>To immerse students in Singapore’s vibrant art landscape, the school organises
curated learning journeys to key museums and exhibitions, including docent-led
visits to the Singapore Art Museum, the Peranakan Museum, and the Singapore
Biennale.</p>
<p>During these experiences, students engage in guided art conversations
and thoughtfully designed tasks that deepen their understanding of visual
elements, aesthetics, and art history. They are encouraged to analyse,
interpret, and articulate their responses to artworks, fostering critical
thinking and visual literacy.</p>
<p>Through reflective discussions both at the museums and back in the classroom,
students learn to localise artistic concepts and select meaningful subject
matter for their own creative expressions. These encounters with authentic
art experiences not only broaden their perspectives but also inspire and
inform their personal art-making journeys.</p>
<p><strong><em>c) Lower Secondary Design &amp; Create Curriculum</em></strong>
<br>Objective: To develop effective communicators and creative thinkers.</p>
<p>The lower secondary Design and Create curriculum allows students to experience
the entire design process from identifying problems to the creation of
solutions. They have the opportunity to pick up basic sketching skills
which allows them to communicate their ideas effectively in their design
journals. They are exposed to different ideation techniques which can be
used to generate better design solutions, honing their creative thinking
skills. Students also get to realise their design ideas by creating artefacts
using various machines and tools in the workshop.</p>
<p><strong><em>d)</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>Upper Secondary Design and Technology Enrichment Programme<br></em></strong>Objective:
To cultivate interest and build relevant skills for the creative industry.
<br>The programme comprises two key components:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Computer-Aided Design (CAD): Students learn to use various tools and rendering
techniques to express their design ideas through 3D modelling software,
SketchUp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elective Modules: Conducted by local industry designers, these modules
equip students with essential creative skills such as sketching, rendering,
and building mock-ups to develop and communicate product and interior design
concepts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>e)</strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>Upper Secondary Food and Beverage Enrichment Programme</em><br></strong>Objective:
To spark students’ interest in Singapore’s Food and Beverage (F&amp;B)
industry.
<br>The programme offers two pathways:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Advanced Elective Modules (AEMs): Conducted by local polytechnics, these
modules guide students in starting and managing their own F&amp;B businesses.
Through hands-on activities, students will develop a simple, sustainable
business plan and design their dream restaurant concept.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elective Modules: A school-based programme where students experience the
working life of a professional chef and gain insight into the operations
of a commercial kitchen</p>
</li>
</ul>
