# **Student Well-being**

### Motivate. Engage. Uplift

At Peirce Secondary School, the culture of care and the individual needs of our students is of utmost importance. We strive to promote a healthy, supportive, accepting, and secure environment for all students. Through our programmes and interactions with our students, we support them in developing resilience, mental and emotional health, a positive sense of self and belonging, and the skills to make positive and healthy choices in support of learning and achievement. 

We have a dedicated team of teachers, school counsellors, Allied Educators (Learning and Behavioural Support) and student welfare officer (SWO) who believes that strong Teacher-student relationship (TSR) and Peer Support and Relationship (PSR) is the key in building a supportive network for our students. With a strong supportive networks, we can help reduce the chances of students falling through the cracks and being vulnerable. 

Below, are the various areas of support given to meet the varied needs of our students.

### Counselling Support

The counselling team in Peirce Secondary School believes in supporting our students systemically in their social and emotional well-being. Besides individual counselling, the team is active in organizing different types of psycho-educational groups to cater to the different needs of the students.

Talks such as Stress Management for Examinations, Healthy Communication, and Social Etiquette skills are done for the general student population, and small psycho-educational groups are conducted for targeted clients. Small groups include Breaking Free from undesirable behaviours, and Anxiety Management skills that further explored helpful strategies. Students who experienced a transition within their families were empowered with self-management skills from a well-known Rainbows Programme that the counselling team conducted in-house.
