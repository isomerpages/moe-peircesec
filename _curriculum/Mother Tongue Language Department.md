### 2\. Department Programmes

**Approaches**

Our key approaches to teaching of MTL include:

*   engaging students in purposeful and active learning in lessons through interactive, authentic and differentiated performance tasks:
*   conducting regular formative assessments to inform both teachers and students on the progress of learning; and
*   providing enrichment programmes for students to actively learn MTL and its associated culture to experience MTL as ‘a living language’.

**Curriculum Programmes**

*   In classroom learning, students are paired / grouped purposefully that facilitate critical thinking and active learning through discussions. Such strategies provide a platform for developing 21st century competencies (21CC) in our students in the area of communication and collaboration skills.
*   We also leverage on use of ICT tools and e-learning platforms to develop self-directed learning and collaborative learning as students acquire mastery of language skills. Lessons and earning tasks posted on Student Learning Space (SLS) provide opportunities for self-directedness in learning

*   **MTL Fortnight and Cultural Camp Programme** provide students with authentic opportunities in using MTL and experience the Chinese, Malay or Tamil cultures
*   **Applied Learning Programme** provide students with an authentic platform to put the language skills they learn in the classroom into an authentic context.
