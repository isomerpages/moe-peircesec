<p>Our school mission is to build ‘<em>A Learning Community that Values Every Individual’</em>. Education is a journey of self-discovery where students discover their talents, strengths and weaknesses and form their moral compass. This philosophy of Education guides our school to put our students at the centre of what we do. We also recognize and acknowledge the important part that teachers, support staff and parents play in journeying with our students. It takes a whole community to nurture one child and at Peirce Secondary School, every child is an important person.</p><p>In learning, we aim to teach our students to Discover, Distil and Discern. Discover the joy of learning new things every day or learn new ways of doing existing things. We want to develop in them the mental agility to embrace change and adapt successfully. In today’s world, we encounter lots of information and we face many challenges. A critical mind is needed in order to Distil what is important and what is not, and to Discern good from bad, true from false and right from wrong.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Yue-Fei-300x225.jpg"></div><p>The statue of Yue Fei and his mother at the foyer of our School reminds us to uphold and live our school values of <strong><em>P</em></strong>assion for <strong><em>Ex</em></strong>cellence, <strong><em>I</em></strong>ntegrity, <strong><em>R</em></strong>espect, <strong><em>C</em></strong>are and <strong>Em</strong>pathy - spell <strong>PEIRCE</strong>.
