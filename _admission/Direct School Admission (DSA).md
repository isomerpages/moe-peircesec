We seek students who can contribute to our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Community Leadership, especially those who can or with the potential and wish to lead student groups and school initiatives to benefit the community. Successful candidates will have the opportunity to hone their character and leadership skills while making a valuable contribution to our school community, and beyond through various exciting experiences.
<br>

**II. Deepening Reflection and Developing Critical Thinking Through Media**<br>
Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) fosters media literacy and cultivates student agency within our Peircean community. By seamlessly integrating media skills into diverse subjects, ALP allows students to delve into subject knowledge, sharpen critical thinking, and connect their learning to real-world challenges. This culminates in sharing of disciplinary insights for the growth of the school population. 

ALP also empowers students who demonstrate greater interest and passion for media and communication. Apart from curricular learning, students also hone their skills through leadership and co-curricular activities, where projects of greater merit are showcased on schoolwide and external platforms, enabling students to become advocates for positive change. Through these experiences, students develop confidence, strengthen media and communication skills and learn to use media skills for the betterment of the community.

Do look out for more information on our two distinctive programmes from 6 May 2024.
