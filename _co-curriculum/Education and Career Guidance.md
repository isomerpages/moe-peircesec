# **Education and Career Guidance**

**Goals of Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**

In Peirce, we aim to equip our students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values so that they are **Future Ready** – have a sense of purpose in life, develop the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning so as to be able to navigate education and career pathways purposefully and take on the challenges of the future, including the world of work.

**Guiding Principles in planning of ECG Experiences:**

1.  Student Centricity – learning experiences are planned based on students’ needs, interests and aspirations.
2.  Intentionality – learning experiences are planned with specific learning outcomes in mind.
3.  Coherence – learning experiences enable students to connect, transfer, and apply learning across different key student development experiences.
4.  Collaboration – establish meaningful partnership with parents, PSEIs and other external organisations
