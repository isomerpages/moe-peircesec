<p>The Basketball team trains twice a week. The team has participated in
the NSG South Zone Basketball Competition (B &amp; C Divisions) as well
as Yio Chu Kang Cup annually. Through the comprehensive programme, the
students would have the right amount of exposure and have a sense of pride
for the CCA.&nbsp; Participation in competitions allows the members to
develop sportsmanship and resilience. Teammates are also expected to treat
one another with respect, courtesy and care.</p>
