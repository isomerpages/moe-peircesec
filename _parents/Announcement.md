</p>
<p>Students should report on Thursday, 2 January 2025, by 7:30 am at the

school population, followed by the flag-raising ceremony. Students need
not bring textbooks on the first day of school. They should bring PE attire,
stationery, a book to read, a water bottle, and money for recess. As there
will not be any special activity to engage parents/ guardians, parents/
guardians need not stay after sending the students to school.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Purchasing of textbooks and uniforms</strong>
</p>
<p>We encourage all parents/ guardians to purchase textbooks and uniforms <strong>online</strong>.
