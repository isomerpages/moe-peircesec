<p>The Volleyball team trains and plays hard twice a week under the expert
hands and watchful eyes of Coach Jerome.&nbsp; The teams have participated
in the NSG South Zone Volleyball Competition (both divisions), tapping
on every possible opportunity to further hone our skills and achieve high
standards of performance.&nbsp; We would like our members to enhance volleyball
skill mastery through comprehensive and rigorous training.&nbsp; Through
the intensive programme, the students would have the passion to excel and
be imbued with a sense of responsibility.&nbsp; Participation in competitions
allows the members to develop sportsmanship, resilience, self and social
awareness â€“ values that would stand them in good stead in future.&nbsp;
Lastly, we encourage teammates to treat each other with respect, courtesy
and care.</p>
