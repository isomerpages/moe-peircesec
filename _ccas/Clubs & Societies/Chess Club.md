<p>The Chess Club was started in 2025 as an interest group. In 2026, it is
formally launched as a CCA. Students may opt to join the Chess Club as
their main CCA, subject to availability of places. Other interested students
may also request to join the Chess Club as a 2nd CCA, or participate in
some activities out of interest.
