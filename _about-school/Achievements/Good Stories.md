<p><strong>Congratulations to Peirce Alumnus Suen Wai Kit on His Outstanding Achievements!</strong>
</p>
<p>Peirce Secondary School is proud to congratulate Suen Wai Kit, who has
graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a Diploma in Media, Arts &amp;
Design. He has also received the Mediacorp Silver Medal and the Mediacorp
Specialisation Prize for his outstanding accomplishments.</p>
<p>Wai Kit's journey into content creation began here at Peirce Secondary
School, where he discovered his passion for current affairs and filmmaking.
He was an active member of the Peirce Wind Symphony, where he not only
honed his ear for music and sound production but also began exploring other
creative interests. As the band's volunteer photographer, he set up its
Facebook page and produced a well-received video for the Handing Over Ceremony.
Wai Kit credits the opportunities he had through the Co-Curricular Activities
(CCA) and the guidance of Ms. Khai in Social Studies for inspiring his
career path, which now blends media, arts, and current affairs.</p>
<p>Wai Kit's accomplishments serve as an inspiration to all our students,
reminding us that discovering one's passion is a journey that often begins
with small steps. Participating in a variety of school activities can lead
to discovering new interests and pave the way for future success.</p>
<p>We are incredibly proud of Wai Kit's achievements and wish him continued
success as he embarks on the next steps in his journey. Congratulations,
Wai Kit! We look forward to seeing the incredible things you will achieve.</p>

<p><strong>Shining Bright at Peirce and Beyond <br>Former Student Amalia Bte Ariffin recently graduated from Nanyang Polytechnic with the top honour of her course – NCSS Gold Medal</strong>
</p>
<p>The care and compassion from the teachers at Peirce will always resonate
with me. Ever ready to provide a listening ear and sage advice, they connected
with sincerity, and it was this sincerity that inspired me to pursue social
work.</p>
<p>A student who was all heart, Amalia graduated from Peirce in 2016 with
numerous accolades to her name. Having been relentless in her academic
pursuits, Amalia clinched the Edusave Scholarship Award for 3 consecutive
years from 2013-2015.</p>
<p>With leadership opportunities being aplenty at Peirce, Amalia was not
only an active member of the Student Council but thrived in her CCA- St
John’s Brigade. She was bestowed the coveted title of Senior Staff Sergeant
in 2016, the highest achievement at the secondary school level. With the
guidance of her CCA teachers, she was awarded Best Unit Cadet Award as
well as the Chief Commissioner’s Award in 2016. Apart from her academic
and CCA achievements, the school recognized Amalia for her exemplary character
and personal qualities and awarded her the Peirce Secondary Character Award
in 2016.</p>
<p>Teachers who were blessed with her presence in class remember her fondly
as an all-rounded young lady who displayed the passion to excel and care
for others in all aspects of her school life. “Amalia went above and beyond
what was required by the syllabus and was always keen to develop the skills
for content mastery. She also willingly shared learning resources with
her friends and never failed to help her classmates who were weaker”, Ms
Khai, the HoD of Humanities, had this to share about Amalia. Mr Dennis
Goh, the HoD of Mathematics, also had glowing words for her. “Apart from
being a hardworking and exemplary student, Amalia was unrivaled in her
ability to cultivate and maintain strong peer relationships.”</p>
<p>Amalia graduated from Peirce Secondary and went on to pursue the Diploma
in Social Sciences (Social Work) at Nanyang Polytechnic. There, she was
awarded the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) Gold Medal. Amalia
is currently majoring in Social Work and minoring in Sociology at the National
University of Singapore. Having developed a keen interest in youth advocacy,
Amalia contributed a series of articles to non-profit organizations in
hopes of reaching out to troubled youth. She also interned at Beyond Social
Services and MSF’s Child Protective Service, where she continues to volunteer
today.</p>
<p>I intend to become a social worker upon my graduation from university.
If there is one thing I’ve taken away from my time at Peirce, it is the
kindness and compassion my teachers have showered on me, and I want to
be able to touch lives and pay this forward!</p>

<p><strong>Staff Learning Day</strong>
</p>
<p>This is the third year we are organising our bi-annual Staff Learning
Day since its inception in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>The theme for 2023 is “Nurturing Future-Ready Learners”</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>We believe that to nurture our students to be future-ready, we need to
enhance their ability to adjust their own cognition and learning and one
of the most effective ways to achieve this will be via the use of the feedback
loop.</p>
<p>Be it self or peer feedback, feedback is one of the most important strategies
of Formative Assessment, which emphasizes on giving students more autonomy
to reflect on their learning, evaluate and make adjustment to their own
learning. Thus, our Professional Learning Teams (PLTs) embarked on this
journey to explore how to make use of self and/or peer assessment to strengthen
students’ metacognition.</p>
<p>For 2023 Staff Learning Day, each department has selected one Professional
Learning Team to present and share their learning during the two concurrent
sessions. We are pleased to share the highlights of the concurrent sessions
(see below). To affirm and celebrate the learning and efforts by all teams,
all PLT synopses including those of the non-presenting teams, will be housed
in our Staff Learning Portal. Indeed, this Staff Learning Day is a testimonial
of the rich learning of our staff and their efforts in bringing the learning
of students to a new level while leveraging on the use of feedback.</p>
<p>For keynote address, we have invited Dr Farhan Ali, Assistant Professor
in the Learning Sciences and Assessment Academic Group, National Institute
of Education to share his insights on the topic of Social Emotional Learning
(SEL). In his talk, Dr Farhan Ali will highlight emerging research related
to the science of social-emotional learning. One of the key highlights
presented will be Dr Farhan’s integrated framework which involves emotion
experiences, emotion awareness, emotion regulation, and meta-emotion. His
presentation will also highlight some applications to the specific educational
contexts such as the learning of content-heavy subjects of Mathematics
and Science, Character and Citizenship Education, and promotion of self-directed
learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to learn from Dr Farhan how to enhance the use of feedback
in our teaching through knowledge of cognitive functions and self-directedness.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>2023 Staff Learning Day promises to be a rich learning experience for
us all!</p>
<p>Highlights of Concurrent Sessions:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Biology: <u>Using Success Criteria in the Feedback Cycle for Biology Planning Practical Task</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/biology.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: The Biology teachers designed a Learning Experience (LE) using
the extended Feedback model that allow students to consider the relationship
between these variables in diverse contexts, before transferring their
knowledge to a given scenario in an assessment.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Craft and Technology: <u>Strategies to Promote Metacognition through Peer Assessment and Self Assessment</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/design.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: Data captured in Padlet and Knowledge Forum were used to analyse
C&amp;T students’ thinking, how they learnt when they were involved in
peer assessment to determine if peer assessment and scaffold had enhanced
students’ metacognition.</p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>English Language: <u>Examining Efficacy of Feedback Style for Summary Writing for Secondary 2 Express</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/english.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: The inquiry method employed is a variant of confirmation inquiry
which seeks to affirm the value of peer feedback as opposed to self- evaluation
on refining the summary writing process. Each class is split into two,
with one solely pursuing self-evaluation/feedback while the other engages
in peer evaluation/feedback in assessing the style of summary writing.
It employs a modified checklist based on a simplified version of the SEAB
rubrics.</p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>History: <u>The Use of Rubrics in the Feedback Cycle for Source-Based Case Study Purpose Skill for Secondary 3 History Students</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/history.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: As students need to have clarity of what the SBQ skill entails,
the History teachers allowed for peer and teacher feedback to have students
to identify their gaps and monitor their understanding of the skill in
this project. After which, students will adjust their own learning by using
the rubrics and applying the learning from the feedback to check for understanding
once more.</p>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Chinese Language: <u>Enhance Secondary 1 Students’ Writing Skills through Peer Evaluation</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/chinese.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: In groups, students collaboratively wrote draft 1 based on
the writing skills required on Google Doc. After completing draft 1, the
teacher got students to highlight sentences which demonstrate the required
writing skills taught. The teacher then led the class to understand the
checklist on using the required writing skills in the appropriate way (tone,
suitability of situation and choice of words). Students then looked at
another group’s essay to assess them on the use and suitability of writing
skills, based on a simplified rubrics and checklist. Students then completed
draft 2 based on peer feedback. This is a very guided process of using
peer feedback for a group of very weak students which leads to positive
outcome.</p>
<ol start="6" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mathematics: <u>Using Flowcharts for Self-Assessment to Build Metacognition</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/mathematics.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: The intentional use of flowcharts and self and/or peer assessment
in the Feed up – Feedback – Feed forward cycle would encourage students
to be actively involved in assessment feedback, thus developing their competence
in monitoring, evaluating, and improving their own learning and enhancing
their capacities for lifelong learning.</p>
<ol start="7" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Pathlight School:<u>Understanding the Learning and Behavioural Needs of Students with ASD Informs Decisions on Classroom Strategies to Improve Their Overall Classroom Engagement</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/pathlight.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: The presentation provides actual classroom examples that have
been developed with the understanding that Students with ASD have preferences
and strengths we can leverage on to improve their engagement in the classroom.
It has enabled us to deliver the MOE curriculum in our Mathematics and
Science lessons, build our own efficacy to meet the needs of our students
and more importantly, improve the students’ self-reflection and self-management.
This in turn enables them to achieve their learning and behavioural goals.</p>
<ol start="8" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Physical Education: <u>Using ICT in Physical Education (PE)</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/physical.jpg">
</div>
<p>Highlight: It was observed that students tend to forget the teaching cue
and were not able to execute the correct technical skills during practice.
The large space in which PE is being taught poses a challenge for PE teachers
to provide feedback to all students within a teaching period. By taping
on feedback and Kolb’s Cycle of Experiential Learning, students could become
more reflective learners who take ownership of improving their own technical
skills.</p>
