As part of the Outdoor Education unit of the PE curriculum, level outdoor adventure camps are organised for Sec. 1 and 3 students.

To ensure safety and a quality programme, qualified external instructors and form teachers are engaged to conduct the activities and facilitate learning. The camp programme includes high elements and a water activity besides teambuilding activities. For the Sec. 3 cohort, the school will make a booking for an MOE-Outward Bound Singapore Challenge Programme whereby students get to experience a more vigorous outdoor adventure programme with students from other schools.

Conducted in the last week of term 3, the Health & Fitness (H&F) Week aims to celebrate and remind Peirceans the importance of healthy living. During this period, the PE department and a team of student leaders organize activities to engage Peirceans in body and mind. Some of the activities include inter class games, inter CCA challenges, health quiz, Staff versus Students 1-minute challenge and Learn @ Peirce modules. Learn @ Peirce are short exposure physical activities conducted by external instructors, examples of such courses are inline skating, muay thai, k-pop dance and archery. The H & F Week culminates in the All Children Exercising Simultaneously (ACES) Day workout. On ACES Day, Peirceans will be reminded the importance of eating fruits and drinking water. Everyone brings a fruit and eat together before the workout.
