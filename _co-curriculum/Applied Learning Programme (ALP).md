<h3>Unleashing the Future Innovators: Our Signature STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</h3>
<h4>AI-Driven STEM: Building Skills for the Digital Age</h4>
<p>At Peirce Secondary, we are committed to equipping our students with the
skills they need to excel in a rapidly changing world. Starting in 2025,
we proudly offer STEM as our Applied Learning Programme (ALP). This programme
is designed to provide an integrated approach to learning, developing 21st
Century Competencies (21CC), while encouraging exploratory learning and
fostering connections across different subjects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our STEM ALP empowers students to be self-directed, engaged, and motivated
learners, ready to tackle the challenges of tomorrow.</p>
<h4>A Hands-On Approach to Learning: The Tier 1 STEM ALP Curriculum</h4>
<p>At Tier 1, the programme is designed to be inclusive, offering every student
the opportunity to explore STEM in a hands-on, dynamic learning environment.
In their lower secondary years, every student will embark on a STEM journey
through our Tier 1 programme, gaining exposure to the exciting worlds of
coding, artificial intelligence (AI), and design thinking. Led by our in-house
computing experts and external partners like STEM Inc, IMDA and AI Singapore,
students will develop core skills to:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Ignite a Passion for Programming:</strong> Students
embark on an exciting journey into coding with micro-controllers, laying
the foundation for future computer scientists.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Unleash the Power of AI: </strong>Our curriculum explores
artificial intelligence, teaching students responsible use of AI to create
stunning images and videos.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Cultivate Creative Thinkers: </strong>We encourage innovative
problem-solving through design and computational thinking, equipping students
to tackle challenges confidently.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; Communicate with Clarity:</strong> Students learn effective
communication skills, presenting ideas clearly while simplifying complex
information and identifying patterns.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; Explore Technology’s Role:</strong> They gain insights
into how computers and data shape daily life, understanding the importance
of programming in today’s industries.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Bringing Ideas to Life: The Power of Projects</strong>
<br>Students will not only learn contemporary STEM concepts—they will also
put them into practice. In secondary 1, they will have the chance to work
on curated STEM projects, applying their newly acquired knowledge. By secondary
2, students can integrate these skills into a Values in Action (VIA) project,
collaborating with community partners to solve real-world problems using
technology. This gives them a chance to make a meaningful impact while
honing their skills.</p>
<h4>Tier 2: Specialising and Mastering Skills in the STEAM Makerspace</h4>
<p>For students with a passion for STEM and who want to take their learning
to the next level, our Tier 2 programme offers specialised opportunities
to hone their skills.&nbsp;
<br>In this space, students can:</p>
<p><strong>Prototype and Tinker:</strong> Explore arts, robotics, and engineering
in our STEAM Makerspace.</p>
<p><strong>Integrate AI: </strong>Use AI to enhance design ideation, coding,
and even report generation.</p>
<p>With a four-year curriculum designed to deepen expertise in science, technology,
engineering, arts, and mathematics, the Art and Makers Club prepares students
for future careers in these exciting fields.</p>
<p><strong>Pathways for All Learners</strong>
<br>Whether part of our G3 Computing class or exploring STEM through Student
Initiated Learning (SIL), students with a passion for AI and coding will
have multiple opportunities to explore their interests. They can participate
in coding workshops, learning journeys, and even internships with esteemed
partners like AI Singapore and local polytechnics, gaining real-world experience
and exposure to future-focused careers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Talent Development</strong>
<br>For students eager to challenge themselves, Peirce offers opportunities
to participate in national-level research projects and competitions. These
experiences not only stretch their abilities but also deepen their passions,
allowing them to explore their interests on a larger scale and broaden
their perspectives.</p>
