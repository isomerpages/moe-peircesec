<p>At Peirce Secondary School, we believe in recognising the diverse talents,
interests and learning needs of our students. Since 2018, we have been
offering students the opportunity to take subjects at more demanding levels
based on their aptitude, interest and readiness. This stems from our commitment
to providing a student-centred education and nurturing the joy of learning
in every child.</p>
<p><strong>Our Philosophy</strong>
<br>We understand that every student is unique. By allowing flexibility in
subject levels, we support students in customising their learning journey.
Whether it’s taking Mathematics at a higher level or exploring strengths
in Mother Tongue or Science, students at Peirce are encouraged to stretch
themselves where they excel and receive support where needed.</p>
<p><strong>What is Full SBB?</strong>
<br>From 2024, all secondary schools in Singapore, including Peirce Secondary,
have fully implemented Full SBB. This is a significant move away from the
traditional streaming system (Express, Normal Academic, Normal Technical)
towards a more flexible and inclusive approach to secondary education.</p>
<p>Under Full SBB:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students are placed in mixed-form classes at Secondary 1 and 2 regardless
of their PSLE scores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They take subjects at G1, G2 or G3 levels (General 1/2/3), depending on
their strengths in each subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject levels are reviewed over time, with opportunities to take subjects
at more demanding levels as students progress.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At Peirce, Full SBB goes beyond just subject placement. It enhances social
mixing as students interact across different academic profiles in the same
form class. Core academic subjects — English, Mother Tongue Language, Mathematics
and Science — are taught in teaching groups based on the subject level
while other subjects such as Art, Design &amp; Technology and Character
&amp; Citizenship Education are conducted in mixed classes, fostering inclusiveness
and empathy.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>
<br>The implementation of Full SBB reflects our school’s vision to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Empower students to learn at a pace that suits them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote interactions across diverse backgrounds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build a community where students develop confidence, compassion and curiosity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through Full SBB, Peirce Secondary continues to create an equitable learning
environment where students grow academically, socially and emotionally.</p>
