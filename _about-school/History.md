<p>From 2007 to 2008, the school embarked on an upgrading exercise (PRIME
Phase 8) of its premises to include an Indoor Sports Hall and other facilities.
The project was completed on schedule and the school returned to its home
campus in December 2008.The school’s synthetic turf was completed and put
to use in June 2011. In 2014, we celebrated 20th anniversary of the school.</p>
