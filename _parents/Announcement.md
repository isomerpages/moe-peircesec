<p><strong><u>Announcement: Peirce Secondary School Secondary 1 posting and registration matters</u></strong>
<br>A very warm welcome to our Peirce Family!

from 9am to 12pm. Please enter the school via the front gate as there is

be available for use when school reopens.&nbsp;
<br>Parents, please take note of the following important matters. Thank you
for your attention.
