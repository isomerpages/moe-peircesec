**Department Programmes**

Our programmes are designed to provide a broad-based holistic Science education.

Objectives:

*   To enable pupils to acquire understanding and knowledge in Science to become resilient learners, gracious citizens in a technological world
*   To develop abilities and skills that are relevant to the study and practices of Science
*   To enthuse students in the learning of Science via the 5E model of inquiry

**5E Model Approach**

Our department adopts the 5E Model of Inquiry in our lessons and programmes.

**Lower Secondary Science Experiential Program (SEP)**&nbsp;

Objective: To engage students to a variety of experiences related to scientific concepts; to equip them with relevant scientific skillsets for inquiry to take place

The Lower Secondary Science Experiential Program (SEP) is a three-week programme for Secondary 1 students to learn Science Process Skills via hands-on experiments. These novel experiences are key to enthusing students and nurturing them to make links across the Science disciplines and concepts learnt within the classroom.

The LSS Trail is a signature event of the SEP. It aims to engage our Lower Secondary students in real-world contexts.

Students will engage in Place-Based Inquiry Learning in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, where they will demonstrate the Science Process Skills learnt during the SEP lessons with their teachers.&nbsp;

**Science Enrichment (Science Centre Programmes)**

Students are actively encouraged by their subject teachers to take part in competitions and projects organized by the Singapore Science Centre.&nbsp;

Our students signed up for the Youth Science Ambassador project in 2019 and the Young Sustainability Champion programme in 2020 and 2021. Through the programme, they are mentored by our teachers and educators from the Singapore Science Centre on project management, global awareness and embark on tasks to raise awareness about sustainability.
