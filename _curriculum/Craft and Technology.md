<h3>2. Department Programmes</h3>
<p><strong><em>a)&nbsp; Artist-in-School Scheme (AISS)<br></em></strong>Objective:
To develop students’ awareness, skills, and understanding of the visual
arts, with a focus on art criticism, portfolio building, and exhibition
curation.</p>
<p>The Artist-in-School Scheme (AISS) provides students with unique, customised
art learning experiences by connecting them directly with practising art
professionals. Through workshops and mentorship sessions, students deepen
their understanding of artistic concepts and processes while gaining first-hand
exposure to industry practices.</p>
<p>Students refine essential skills such as critical analysis of artworks,
portfolio development for further studies, and curating exhibitions to
showcase artistic narratives. The programme also offers rare behind-the-scenes
insights into the realities of working in the creative sector, as artists
share personal experiences and career journeys within the evolving art
scene.</p>
<p>Ultimately, AISS empowers students not just to create art, but to think,
critique, and present like true art practitioners.</p>
<p><strong><em>b) Museum Art Education Package</em></strong>
<br>Objective: To develop students’ ability to perceive, appreciate, and communicate
through the visual arts.</p>
<p>To immerse students in Singapore’s vibrant art landscape, the school organises
curated learning journeys to key museums and exhibitions, including docent-led
visits to the Singapore Art Museum, the Peranakan Museum, and the Singapore
Biennale.</p>
<p>During these experiences, students engage in guided art conversations
and thoughtfully designed tasks that deepen their understanding of visual
elements, aesthetics, and art history. They are encouraged to analyse,
interpret, and articulate their responses to artworks, fostering critical
thinking and visual literacy.</p>
<p>Through reflective discussions both at the museums and back in the classroom,
students learn to localise artistic concepts and select meaningful subject
matter for their own creative expressions. These encounters with authentic
art experiences not only broaden their perspectives but also inspire and
inform their personal art-making journeys.</p>
<p><strong><em>c) Lower Secondary Design &amp; Create Curriculum</em></strong>
<br>Objective: To develop students’ design capability through Knowledge Building.</p>
<p>The Lower Secondary D&amp;T curriculum immerses students in design experiences
that mirror real-world practice. Students are guided to build knowledge
together, sharing and developing ideas collaboratively in their design
journals and class discussions. Through this process, they learn to improve
ideas collectively rather than just individually.</p>
<p>They acquire foundational sketching skills to communicate their thinking
clearly and explore a range of ideation techniques that stimulate originality
and deepen their creative capacity. Beyond ideation, students turn their
concepts into reality by creating prototypes in the workshop, where they
learn to work safely and effectively with materials, tools, and machines.</p>
<p>This combination of knowledge building, creative thinking, and hands-on
making nurtures students into confident, reflective, and innovative problem-solvers.</p>
<p><strong><em>d)</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>Upper Secondary Design and Technology Enrichment Programme<br></em></strong>Objective:
To cultivate students’ ability to design for sustainability, human flourishing,
and the responsible use of AI, equipping them to create solutions that
are environmentally responsible, socially meaningful, and future-ready.</p>
<p>The Upper Secondary D&amp;T curriculum deepens students’ understanding
of how design impacts people, society, and the planet. Students learn to
analyse user needs, conduct research, and evaluate ideas critically with
an emphasis on sustainable materials, circular design principles, and systems
thinking. They are encouraged to consider the well-being of users, the
long-term consequences of design decisions, and the potential for their
solutions to improve quality of life.</p>
<p>AI tools are introduced as co-thinkers, helping students generate, refine,
and test ideas while strengthening their evaluative and ethical reasoning.
Students learn to question AI-generated outputs, compare alternatives,
and make human-centred, ethically informed design choices.</p>
<p>Through iterative prototyping, reflective practice, and critical use of
AI, students develop technical expertise, creativity, and an ethical sensibility,
preparing them to contribute thoughtfully to a future where design serves
both people and the planet.</p>
<p><strong>e)</strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>Upper Secondary Food and Beverage Enrichment Programme</em><br></strong>Objective:
To spark students’ interest in Singapore’s Food and Beverage (F&amp;B)
industry.
<br>The programme offers two pathways:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Advanced Elective Modules (AEMs): Conducted by local polytechnics, these
modules guide students in starting and managing their own F&amp;B businesses.
Through hands-on activities, students will develop a simple, sustainable
business plan and design their dream restaurant concept.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elective Modules: A school-based programme where students experience the
working life of a professional chef and gain insight into the operations
of a commercial kitchen</p>
</li>
</ul>
