**Learning Outcomes**

The Art Club aims to cultivate a strong interest in the visual arts in our students through&nbsp; enhancing their art-making skills and appreciation for the visual arts. From participating in various art competitions to learning from artists and learning journeys to art galleries and museums, students gain exposure and awareness of social issues and the visual arts scene in Singapore and globally.

Students are encouraged to experiment with a plethora of materials and mediums to explore their thoughts, feelings and ideas, and develop skills to make critical judgments about artworks and art practices through the study of visual arts. Collaborative art-making also encourages bonding amongst our members and provides a safe space for our students to explore, experiment and create art together.&nbsp;

Some of our art activities include:

*   3D art – Ceramics, Super Sculpey clay-sculpting
*   Printmaking – Monoprints and Linoleum printing
*   Digital Art – Digital painting on Procreate, Pixel art GIFs and Stop Motion Animation
